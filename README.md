Customer Churn Analysis Using Machine Learning
Introduction
Customer churn, particularly in the telecommunications industry, presents a significant challenge due to high customer acquisition costs and the potential for revenue loss. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models, helping telecom companies proactively identify and retain at-risk customers.

Objective
The main objective is to build an efficient machine learning model capable of predicting whether a customer will churn. This enables businesses to take proactive measures for customer retention, reducing churn rates and increasing profitability.

Technologies and Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Handling arrays and numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms.
Google Colab: Cloud-based platform for interactive coding and model training.
Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple features related to customer demographics, service subscriptions, and billing information. Key columns include:

Customer Information: Age, gender, tenure, contract type, etc.
Service Information: Phone service, internet service, streaming services, etc.
Billing Information: Monthly charges, total charges, payment method, etc.
Target Variable: Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Missing values were imputed using the median for numerical columns and the mode for categorical columns.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Used one-hot encoding for categorical features (e.g., gender, payment method).
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler was applied to continuous features such as tenure and monthly charges.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn Distribution: 26% of the customers churned.
Correlation Analysis: Attributes like total charges, tenure, and contract type were highly correlated with churn.
Visualizations: Pair plots, box plots, and heatmaps were used to explore relationships between features.
Machine Learning Models
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Tuned with different values of k to find the optimal model.

Training Accuracy: 79.88%
Test Accuracy: 79.56%
Logistic Regression: Simple and effective for binary classification tasks like churn prediction.

Performance: Competitive but less accurate than ensemble models.
Decision Tree Classifier: Tuned depth and other hyperparameters to reduce overfitting.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Evaluated with different kernels using grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to increase model robustness and accuracy.

Model Evaluation
Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions (both churn and non-churn).
Confusion Matrix: Used to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Precision evaluates the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall focuses on correctly identifying churned customers. F1-score balances both.
Model Comparison
KNN and Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy.
Random Forest had better generalization and reduced overfitting due to its ensemble nature.
Logistic Regression and SVM performed reasonably but with lower accuracy compared to KNN and Random Forest.
Conclusion
This project successfully predicted customer churn using machine learning techniques. The Random Forest and KNN models were the top performers, providing telecom companies with an actionable solution for identifying at-risk customers. The insights gained from this project can lead to better retention strategies and reduce churn rates.

Future Scope
Advanced Models: Implementing more sophisticated models like XGBoost or Neural Networks could further improve prediction accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Introducing new features such as customer interaction data or sentiment analysis from customer service calls.
Deployment: Deploy the model using cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud) to integrate real-time churn prediction in business operations.
